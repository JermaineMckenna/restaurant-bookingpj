# üçΩÔ∏è La Tavola Italiana : Project 3
---
## üìñ Project Overview

The Restaurant Booking System Project is a full-stack web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Django, designed to provide users with a smooth and responsive experience when reserving a table at a restaurant.

The website allows visitors to browse the restaurant‚Äôs menu, make online bookings, and send contact messages ‚Äî all within a clean and mobile-friendly interface.

The project demonstrates the integration of a relational database, with PostgreSQL handling data for bookings, contact messages, and tables.

Users can submit reservation details via a secure online form, which is processed and stored in the database for the site owner to manage.

This application was developed as part of my Code Institute Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development, showcasing skills in full-stack development, database management, and deployment using Heroku.

The system aligns with the course‚Äôs mandatory project criteria by providing complete CRUD functionality, structured front-end design, and integration with external APIs (Google Calendar).

The site aims to simplify restaurant reservations by offering a digital alternative to traditional booking methods, while maintaining an elegant and authentic Italian-inspired design theme throughout the interface.

###<u>Design</u>

<u>Colour Scheme</u>

The restaurant website uses a warm and authentic Italian-inspired color palette, designed to reflect a welcoming, high-quality dining atmosphere. The combination of colors is elegant yet comforting ‚Äî echoing the tones of Italian interiors and cuisine.

 ### Colour - Hex Code - Purpose

- Ivory	#fff8f0	Used as the main background color to create warmth and readability

- Deep Green	#2e7d32	Used for headings and highlights to symbolize freshness and nature

- Italian Red	#c62828	Used for buttons and key accents to represent passion and Italian heritage

- Dark Charcoal	#333	Used for standard text for easy readability

- Soft Cream	#fdf6f0	Used in hero and content sections for a subtle & luxurious tone.

These colors work together to create a consistent brand identity that is both modern and inspired by traditional Italian design sensibilities.

---
###<u>Typography</u>

Two fonts were chosen to complement the restaurant‚Äôs aesthetic and ensure readability across all devices:

Playfair Display ‚Äì used for headings to add a classic, elegant feel (serif font inspired by traditional Italian signage).

Poppins ‚Äì used for body text to maintain clean, modern readability with a friendly tone.

Both fonts are imported via Google Fonts and are supported by standard sans-serif fallbacks.

Imagery plays a vital role in the restaurants visual experience:
