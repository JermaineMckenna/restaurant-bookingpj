# üçΩÔ∏è La Tavola Italiana : Project 3
---
## üìñ Project Overview

The Restaurant Booking System Project is a full-stack web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Django, designed to provide users with a smooth and responsive experience when reserving a table at a restaurant.

The website allows visitors to browse the restaurant‚Äôs menu, make online bookings, and send contact messages ‚Äî all within a clean and mobile-friendly interface.

The project demonstrates the integration of a relational database, with PostgreSQL handling data for bookings, contact messages, and tables.

Users can submit reservation details via a secure online form, which is processed and stored in the database for the site owner to manage.

This application was developed as part of my Code Institute Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development, showcasing skills in full-stack development, database management, and deployment using Heroku.

The system aligns with the course‚Äôs mandatory project criteria by providing complete CRUD functionality, structured front-end design, and integration with external APIs (Google Calendar).

The site aims to simplify restaurant reservations by offering a digital alternative to traditional booking methods, while maintaining an elegant and authentic Italian-inspired design theme throughout the interface.

###<u>Design</u>

<u>Colour Scheme</u>

The restaurant website uses a warm and authentic Italian-inspired color palette, designed to reflect a welcoming, high-quality dining atmosphere. The combination of colors is elegant yet comforting ‚Äî echoing the tones of Italian interiors and cuisine.

 ### Colour - Hex Code - Purpose

- Ivory	#fff8f0	Used as the main background color to create warmth and readability

- Deep Green	#2e7d32	Used for headings and highlights to symbolize freshness and nature

- Italian Red	#c62828	Used for buttons and key accents to represent passion and Italian heritage

- Dark Charcoal	#333	Used for standard text for easy readability

- Soft Cream	#fdf6f0	Used in hero and content sections for a subtle & luxurious tone.

These colors work together to create a consistent brand identity that is both modern and inspired by traditional Italian design sensibilities.

---
###<u>Typography</u>

Two fonts were chosen to complement the restaurant‚Äôs aesthetic and ensure readability across all devices:

Playfair Display ‚Äì used for headings to add a classic, elegant feel (serif font inspired by traditional Italian signage).

Poppins ‚Äì used for body text to maintain clean, modern readability with a friendly tone.

Both fonts are imported via Google Fonts and are supported by standard sans-serif fallbacks.

[Click here for Google Fonts Link](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display)

This pairing creates a clear hierarchy between headings and body text while keeping the designs visually balanced.

---
###<u>Imagery</u>

Imagery plays a vital role in the restaurants visual experience:

- The hero section features Italian dining or cuisine photography that instantly communicates the atmosphere.

- The menu cards and about section images are styled with round edges and soft shadows to maintain consistency and profressionalism.

- All images were optimized for performance and responsiveness, ensuring fast load times on both desktop and mobile devices.

Overall the projects imagery focuses on food, culture and hospitality, all key emotional triggers for users looking to book at a restaurant.

---
###<u>Layout and Structure</u>

The layout follows a mobile-first responsive design, structured with Bootstrap‚Äôs grid system for consistency and scalability.
All sections ‚Äî such as the hero, about, menu preview, booking form, and contact ‚Äî adapt fluidly to various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal experience across devices from small smartphones to large monitors.

Key layout features:

- Responsive navigation bar and footer across all pages

- Centered hero content with overlay text for impact

- Grid-based menu layout for clear food item presentation

- Well-structured forms with spacing, validation, and responsive input fields

- Balanced use of white space and color accents to keep the site visually calm and readable

---
###<u>Accessibility</u>

Accessibility best practices were implemented throughout the design.

- All interactive elements (buttons, links, forms) have clear focus states and accessible labels.

- High color contrast between text and backgrounds ensures legibility.

- Semantic HTML tags are used for headings, sections, and navigation elements to improve screen reader compatibility.

- Forms include placeholder text and ARIA labels for usability.

### üì≤ Further Testing

Extensive testing was carried out throughout the development and deployment of the project to ensure that all features and functionality worked correctly and consistently across different devices and browsers.

- The website was manually tested on multiple devices, including:
iPhone SE, iPhone 13, iPad, MacBook Pro, and 24‚Äù Monitor
Android devices such as Samsung Galaxy S22
The project was tested using browser developer tools in Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari.

- Each page ‚Äî Home, Menu, Booking, and Contact ‚Äî was checked for proper alignment, spacing, and responsiveness at various screen sizes.

- The Bootstrap grid system and custom media queries were verified to ensure that layout elements such as cards, buttons, and hero sections scale correctly.

- The site was also tested using online responsiveness testing tools (such as Am I Responsive and Responsinator) to confirm that content displays properly across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.

<u>Browser Compatibility</u>

The project was tested on the following browsers:

- Google Chrome (latest version)

- Mozilla Firefox

- Safari (macOS)

- Microsoft Edge

- Functionality, styling, and responsiveness were consistent across all browsers.

- Minor spacing and text alignment adjustments were made to ensure pixel-perfect consistency between Chrome and Safari.

<u>Form Testing</u>

Both the Booking and Contact forms were tested extensively to ensure correct functionality and validation.

**Form Validation:**

- Required fields correctly prevent submission when left empty.

- Email and date fields only accept valid inputs (e.g., proper email format, future dates).

- Validation messages display correctly when users attempt to submit incomplete forms.

**Booking Form:**

- Submitting the form successfully adds a new booking record to the PostgreSQL database.

- A confirmation success page appears after each valid submission.

- Bookings automatically send data to the linked Google Calendar API (if enabled).

**Contact Form:**

- Successfully saves user messages into the database.

- Displays a confirmation redirect after successful submission.

<u>API & Database Testing</u>

- API endpoints for Booking and ContactMessage were tested via Django‚Äôs REST Framework.

- Each endpoint (/api/bookings/ and /api/messages/) returns accurate JSON data.

- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) were confirmed to work correctly through the Django admin panel and API browser interface.

- PostgreSQL database integration on Heroku was confirmed to store and retrieve all records successfully.

- The Google Calendar API was tested using valid service credentials; event creation was confirmed via the Google Calendar dashboard.

## üêõ Known Bugs 

- API Configuration on Heroku:

The Google Calendar API required reconfiguration after deployment to Heroku due to environment variable formatting issues. Although the credentials were correctly set locally, Heroku sometimes misinterpreted JSON strings within environment variables. 

The issue was resolved by reformatting the GOOGLE_CREDS value and redeploying the app.

- Responsiveness Testing Tools:

Some third-party responsiveness checkers (e.g., Am I Responsive) were unable to display the live Heroku app due to Django‚Äôs X_FRAME_OPTIONS security policy. This did not affect normal site usage ‚Äî the site remains fully responsive and accessible on all device types.

- Minor Spacing and Alignment Adjustments:
During testing, small layout inconsistencies appeared between Safari and Chrome. These were resolved with custom CSS media queries.
