# 🍽️ La Tavola Italiana : Project 3

## 📖 Project Overview

The Restaurant Booking System Project is a full-stack web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Django, designed to provide users with a smooth and responsive experience when reserving a table at a restaurant.

The website allows visitors to browse the restaurant’s menu, make online bookings, and send contact messages — all within a clean and mobile-friendly interface.

The project demonstrates the integration of a relational database, with PostgreSQL handling data for bookings, contact messages, and tables.

Users can submit reservation details via a secure online form, which is processed and stored in the database for the site owner to manage.

This application was developed as part of my Code Institute Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development, showcasing skills in full-stack development, database management, and deployment using Heroku.

The system aligns with the course’s mandatory project criteria by providing complete CRUD functionality, structured front-end design, and integration with external APIs (Google Calendar).

The site aims to simplify restaurant reservations by offering a digital alternative to traditional booking methods, while maintaining an elegant and authentic Italian-inspired design theme throughout the interface.
